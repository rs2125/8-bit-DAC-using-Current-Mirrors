# 8-bit-DAC-using-Current-Mirrors
In this project we designed, analysed and simulated an 8-bit DAC using different types of current mirrors.
Simple Current Mirror, Cascode Current Mirror and Low Voltage Sooch Cascode Current Mirrors were designed for this project.
For the purpose of this project, the 8-bit binary input ranged from -1V to 1V and a power supply of 1.2V was used.
We compared the output waveforms, observed the step size and the general accuracy of the current mirrors.
PTM 65nm bulk model was used for PMOS in this project.
